It doesn't make sense that Brie Larson won best actress but not best new actor.. Like surely if she's the best she's the best.

Brie Larson's was heartbreaking.

@FeitsBarstool Room was incredible, was already a fan of Brie Larson before it, even bigger one now.
I disliked "Room" a lot. Brie Larson will win an Oscar, for sure. That kid, though. Had a hard time getting around the fact he annoyed me.

Jennifer Lawrence, Alicia Vikander, Brie Larson, Carey Mulligan. Where are their 20-something male equivalents?  It's a lost generation.
So far my favorite #Oscars Best Picture faves are #Spotlight &amp; #TheMartian. Leo was great in #TheRevenant, Brie Larson was superb in #Room
Brie Larson! https://t.co/ISxESYvYr3

How about no Academy Award for Best Actor this year and in turn Saoirse Ronan and Brie Larson both win Oscars for Best Actress? @TheAcademy
Looking forward to the Oscars this weekend, pulling hard for Brie Larson -- Her performance in Room was truly brilliant.
EVERYONE watch Room, Brie Larson is amazing yet again. Jack is outstanding. Go watch
It should win every award ever

Best Actress: Brie Larson is my pick in this eclectic year. Interesting year when Jennifer Lawrence is weakest performance of nominees.

@AlishaGrauso Leo for best actor and Emmanuel Lubezki for cinematography have to be locks at this stage. I'd argue Brie Larson is too.

Brie Larson and Gaga are both the predicted winners of their Oscar categories, and I am having so much anxiety. Pull through, queens.

Just watched Room, the best by far of the Best Picture nominees I've seen. Wonderful filmmaking. Brie Larson &amp; Jacob Tremblay are amazing.

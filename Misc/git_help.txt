Emily, this is for you!! :)

Rules of thumb:

	1. PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH. I REPEAT. PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH.
	2. Commit small. Don't put 10 files in one commit.
	3. Commit often. Don't change 20 things and then commit.
	4. Meaningful commit messages. 
		BAD: "Fixed some stuff"
		GOOD: "Added file output for tweet search results"

When using Git, here is the workflow:

	0. Set up name and email for GitHub, if you haven't done that already.

		git config --global user.name "myUsername"
		git config --global user.email "me@email.com"

	1. Clone the repo so you have a local copy (which you've done already)
		
		git clone <repo_url>
	i.e.	git clone https://github.com/Lucinda-K/Twitter_MTVMovieAwards.git

	2. BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES, make sure you pull the changes from the master branch.

		git pull

	3. Code code code. If you intend on changing a file that's mine, let me know, so I can commit my changes, and you can pull.

	4. Add files you want to be commited

		git add <filename>

		4a. Check the status, make sure it's all good. git status lists all the changed and added files.

		git status

	5. Commit with a meaningful message

		git commit -m "Message text"

	6. Push your changes to GitHub!

		git push origin master

	7. Rejoice. Then keep working.
